# Movie App

### Welcome to the Movie App!

This is my first Android Application, where I've built a movie introduction app.
As I'm still learning advanced Android development, this project is a result of my initial learning journey.

### Features

* Browse through a list of movies
* Get movie details (title, genre, director, etc.)
* Save Movies in Favorites
* Rotate Friendly

### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Loperdax/Learning_app_Movies.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device

### Note

This project is still under development, and there are many features to be added.
If you want to contribute or report any issues, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
